Node Project 

Hello and Welcome to this installment of Github tours. Today we'll be exploring LIRI bot, a project that uses node and contains four commands. 
Typing "concert-this" and a band uses the Bands In Town API to locate where and when future concerts are.
Typing "spotify-this-song" and a song name uses the Spotify API to find the artist, album, and a preview URL.
Typing "movie-this" and a movie title brings back a multitude of information about the movie.
"do-what-it-says" reads a text file and invokes the spotify-this-song command on the text.
